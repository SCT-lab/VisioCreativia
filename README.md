## What is VisioCreativia?
Visio Creativia aims to empower artists to craft 3D art galleries without code, by use of structured procedural generation and is set up as a plug-in for Unreal engine. VisioCreativia is funded by the EU Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative.

## Features
* <img src="https://github.com/SCT-lab/VisioCreativia/blob/main/Images/logo4.PNG" width="20"> Buildings are generated by use of the spline tool to draw outlines;
* <img src="https://github.com/SCT-lab/VisioCreativia/blob/main/Images/logo4.PNG" width="20"> Walls are constructed from a variety of prefabricated shapes as input for the procedural 3D content;
* <img src="https://github.com/SCT-lab/VisioCreativia/blob/main/Images/logo4.PNG" width="20"> Expansive toolset of shapes for procedural generation;

## Installation
MetaVision requires Unreal Engine 5.3.2 and Procedural Content Generation(PCG) Framework plug-in enabled. Unzip the contents in the Plug-ins directory of your project( if there's none, create a folder and name it to 'Plugins'. Then, enable the plugin from the editor via "Edit> Plugins" -MetaVision. The package size is 2.28 MB as compressed, 9MB extracted.
Everything should be in the Plugins > MetaVision Content > Tools

## Developer notes - Exporting: How do I get my gallery online?
The easiest option is to export the contents in .GTLF format which is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D models, designed to be the "JPEG of 3D" and widely used in web and mobile applications for its compactness and ease of use. Meaning you can export your 3D gallery to a web page. An example is below:

Other options we explored include Pixel Streaming, or 3D video rendering.
